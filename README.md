# CyberCanyonDataBase
From the DS.«CyberCanyon©» team, database for AI learning and other projects

- The database is an impressive treasure trove of knowledge about words in Russian and English.
- Information from various sources is collected for each word.
- Each word is accompanied by ten examples of its use in different contexts and meanings. Each example indicates which word was used in a particular context.
- In addition, 255 images are provided for each word, which reflect its subject matter.
- This database allows you to understand how a word is perceived emotionally, both in the context of a sentence and in isolation from it.
